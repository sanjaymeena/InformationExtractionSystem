Food is material that comes from animals or plants. Food is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people need to be healthy. People need to eat protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to be healthy. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks".

Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening, and includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.


Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be transformed by industrial processes (the food industry). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives. Preservative, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavour enhancers etc are food additives.

At home, food is prepared in the kitchen, by the cook. The cook sometimes uses a cookbook. Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cooker, pot, and pan.

Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants (often workers, or in the evening for entertainment) or refectory (in particular for kids in school).

The utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork.

Most people do not grow their own food, so they have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People buy most of their food in stores, shops, or markets. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.

People may buy food and take it home to cook it, or buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor, or in a restaurant.
